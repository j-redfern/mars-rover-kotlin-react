# Mars Rover

Building an interactive Mars Rover web application for self learning purposes. 
This is the FE part of the repository, which connects to the BE via REST API.

Idea of the application is to:

- enter the starting co-ordinates (X,Y) 
- enter facing direction (N.S.E.W) 
- enter the moving commands (F.B.L.R)
- display final position of the robot on the screen

| **Direction** | **Commands** |
|---------------|:-------------|
|N -> North     | F -> Forward |
|S -> South     | B -> Back    |
|E -> East      | L -> Left    |
|W -> West      | R -> Right   |
