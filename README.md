# Mars Rover

Building a web application using Kotlin Js and React for self learning purposes.
This is the frontend part of the repository.

Idea is to:

- enter the starting co-ordinates (X,Y) 
- enter facing direction (N.S.E.W) 
- enter the moving commands (F.B.L.R)
- display final position of the robot on the screen

| **Direction** | **Commands** |
|---------------|:-------------|
|N -> North     | F -> Forward |
|S -> South     | B -> Back    |
|E -> East      | L -> Left    |
|W -> West      | R -> Right   |


### To run the application

`Yarn start`

### Local host

`http://localhost:8080/`

### Notes
